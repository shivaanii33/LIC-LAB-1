# Experiment-1
Question : Given that POWER, P=100µ W; Perform DC Analysis, Transient Analysis and AC Analysis for the Given Circuit Designs and also check what happens when the width is increased or decreased of each mosfet;
# Design-1 :



Aim : To find DC operating point,find gain using transient analysis and AC analysis.

Components : Mosfet,resistors,DC power supply.

Procedure :

• Make the circuit connection as show above.

• Connect the RD resistor to the drain terminal and DC power supply to the gate terminal as well as to the resistor.

• Connect the source terminal to the ground.

• Set the input voltage to 0.9 V and VDD to 1.8 V.

Using the Formula for Power, 

P=V*I
